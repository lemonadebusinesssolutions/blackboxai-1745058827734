# Wellness Pro Backend

## Project Overview
Wellness Pro Backend is the server-side application for the Wellness Pro app, a holistic well-being platform designed to help users manage and enhance their overall wellness. This backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle HTTP requests, manage user authentication, and connect to a MySQL database through Sequelize ORM.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12 or higher)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (any version supported by `mysql2` package)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wellness-pro-backend.git
cd wellness-pro-backend
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify the following environment variables:
```
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/your_database_name
PORT=3000
```

## Usage
To start the server in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
For production, run:
```bash
npm start
```

You can now access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
- User authentication using [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)
- Password hashing with [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
- Session management with Sequelize store for sessions
- RESTful API design for easy integration with frontend applications
- Error handling middleware for standardized error responses
- Flash messaging for feedback on authentication processes
